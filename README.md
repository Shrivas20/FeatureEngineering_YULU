## About the Project

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset related to bike rentals from the Yulu service. The analysis covers the following key aspects:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** A comprehensive examination of the dataset to uncover patterns and insights.
- **Trend and Seasonality Analysis:** Investigation of trends and seasonal variations in bike rentals over time.
- **Weather and Season Impact on Bike Rentals:** Analysis of how weather conditions and seasonal changes affect rental demand.
- **Delivery Time and Payment Method Analysis:** Exploration of delivery times and the impact of different payment methods on bike rentals.

## Key Findings

1. **Seasonal Patterns:** The number of bike rentals showed significant variations across different seasons, with higher demand during spring and summer.
2. **Weather Impact:** The demand for bike rentals was strongly dependent on weather conditions, with a decrease in rentals as the weather became less favorable (e.g., higher rainfall).
3. **Working Day vs. Holiday:** There was no significant difference in the number of bike rentals between working days and holidays.
4. **Payment Preferences:** Credit card was the most popular payment method for bike rentals.

## Recommendations

Based on the insights gained from the analysis, the following recommendations are provided:

- **Seasonal Marketing Focus:** Promote bike rentals aggressively during spring and summer to capitalize on peak demand.
- **Weather-based Campaigns:** Launch promotions and incentives on favorable weather days to attract more customers.
- **Customer Comfort Enhancements:** Offer amenities like umbrellas or water bottles to enhance the biking experience during high-humidity or moderate temperature conditions.
- **Enhanced Weather Data Collection:** Improve data gathering for extreme weather events to better understand customer behavior and adapt offerings accordingly.

## Conclusion

The analysis of the Yulu bike rental data provides valuable insights into customer behavior and external factors influencing rentals. Implementing the recommendations can help Yulu optimize its service offerings and enhance customer satisfaction.
